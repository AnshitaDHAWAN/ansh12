You can create pull requests on GitHub.com, with GitHub Desktop, in Codespaces, on GitHub Mobile, and when using GitHub CLI.

After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes
made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or teams. For more information, see "Creating a pull request."
